## Step-by-Step Update Process

### 1. Preparation (IMPORTANT!)

```bash
# Backup your current state
git checkout master
git status
# Commit or stash any local changes

# Create a backup branch (optional but recommended)
git checkout -b backup-before-upstream-merge
git checkout master
```

### 2. Add Upstream Remote (if not already added)

```bash
# Check if upstream is configured
git remote -v

# If upstream is not listed, add it:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-viewer.git

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream
```

### 3. Pull Upstream Changes

```bash
# Ensure you're on master
git checkout master

# Pull from upstream
git pull upstream master

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them:
# 1. Open conflicted files in your editor
# 2. Resolve conflicts (look for <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>> markers)
# 3. Stage resolved files: git add <file>
# 4. Complete the merge: git commit
```

### 4. Push to Your Fork

```bash
# Push updated master to your fork
git push origin master
```

### 5. Post-Update Verification

```bash
# Verify you're up to date
git log --oneline -5

# Rebuild the project
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run tests
ctest
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

1. **Qt6 Required**: The upstream now uses Qt6. Ensure you have Qt6 installed.
2. **CMake Only**: qmake project files removed. Use CMake.
3. **mainwindow.cpp**: Major refactoring - check if you have custom modifications here.

### üí° Recommended Approach

Given the large number of changes (1,395 commits), consider:

**Option A: Direct Merge (Faster)**
- Pull all changes at once
- Deal with conflicts as they arise
- Best if you have minimal custom changes

**Option B: Incremental Updates (Safer)**
```bash
# Cherry-pick major PRs one by one
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
# Test after each major change
```

**Option C: Fresh Fork (Cleanest)**
- If you have no custom changes
- Delete your fork and re-fork from upstream
- Start fresh with latest code
