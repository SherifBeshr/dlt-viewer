### 1. Before Pulling Changes

- **Backup your current work**: Ensure all local changes are committed or stashed
- **Review your custom modifications**: Check if you have any local changes that might conflict
- **Test your current build**: Document the current state of your fork

### 2. Pulling Changes

```bash
# Ensure you're on the master branch
git checkout master

# Pull from upstream
git pull upstream master

# Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
# After resolving conflicts:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge upstream changes from COVESA/dlt-viewer"

# Push to your fork
git push origin master
```

### 3. After Pulling Changes

- **Rebuild the project**: With Qt6 and updated CMake configurations
- **Run tests**: Verify new unit tests pass
- **Test key features**: Especially if you rely on specific functionality
- **Update dependencies**: May need to update Qt to version 6 if not already

### 4. Consider Incremental Updates

Given the large number of changes (1,395 commits), you might consider:
- Reviewing the changes in batches
